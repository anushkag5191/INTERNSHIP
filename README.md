# Digital-clock
The Digital Clock is a real-time web application that displays the current hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it dynamically fetches the current system time and formats it in a 12-hour or 24-hour format based on preference (optional).

🔧 Features:
Real-time time display using JavaScript’s Date object

Automatic update every second (setInterval)

Clean and responsive UI

Customizable styles (optional: dark/light theme toggle)

👨‍💻 Tech Stack:
HTML – Structure of the clock

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Time logic and live updates

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript's date/time manipulation, DOM updates, and event-driven programming.
