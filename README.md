#🌐 Portfolio Website
The Portfolio Website is a personal web project designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information in a visually appealing and user-friendly format. It acts as a digital resume, helping visitors learn about my background, technical expertise, and the web development work I've done as an intern and student.

Home Section – Introduction with a brief overview of who I am

Projects Section – Interactive cards/tiles displaying the projects I’ve built (e.g., To-Do App, Calculator, Movie Search, Quiz App)

Skills Section – Highlights my tech stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)

Contact Section – Simple contact form or links to email/social profiles

Responsive Design – Fully functional across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens

Smooth Navigation – Includes navbar with internal links to scroll to sections

👨‍💻 Tech Stack:

This project demonstrates my ability to design and build complete websites from scratch and is a central part of my web development journey.
